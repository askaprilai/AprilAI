üéØ HOW TO CONNECT REAL AUDIO:

1. FIX ELEVENLABS API KEY:
   - Check your ElevenLabs dashboard
   - Regenerate API key if needed
   - Verify voice ID: 1KtMKr5khbNAxBQoRs3X

2. GENERATE REAL AUDIO:
   node daily-ripple-generator.js --test
   
   If that works, then run:
   npm run generate

3. WEBSITE WILL AUTOMATICALLY USE:
   - ./audio/monday-momentum.mp3
   - ./audio/tuesday-truth.mp3
   - ./audio/wednesday-wisdom.mp3
   - ./audio/thursday-thinking.mp3
   - ./audio/friday-focus.mp3

4. START THE BACKEND:
   npm run dev
   
5. OPEN DAILY RIPPLE PAGE:
   Open daily-ripple-page.html in browser

üîß TROUBLESHOOTING ELEVENLABS:
- Visit: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings
- Copy new API key to .env file
- Ensure you have credits in your account
- Check voice ID is correct

üí° FOR NOW, THE WEBSITE SHOWS:
- Episode titles and descriptions
- Player interface (will say "audio not available")
- All community features work
- Ready for real audio when API is fixed
